<h1>Headline</h1>

<p>Every year, thousands of people are arrested. This project seeks to map the arrests that occurred by NYPD in NYC, providing details about the perpetrator and the crime. Using that data, and with the help of infographics, an accurate representation of crime rates in NYC can be conveyed.</p>

<h1>Data cleansing</h1>
<p>1. Remove unneccessary data that the general public would not understand, such as law codes, using excel.
   2. Convert the trimmed dataset into a json object in format_data.py.
</p>

<text>All data is from NYC OpenData.</text>
