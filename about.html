<h1>Arrest Demographics in NYC, 2023</h1>

<h2>Every year, thousands of people are arrested in NYC alone. This project seeks to map the arrests that occurred by NYPD in 2023, providing details about the perpetrator and the crime. Using this data, and with the help of infographics, an accurate representation of crime rates in each borrow can be conveyed and compared.</h2>
