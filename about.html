<h1>Arrest Demographics in NYC, 2023</h1>

<text>Every year, thousands of people are arrested in NYC alone. This project seeks to map the arrests that occurred by NYPD in 2023, providing details about the perpetrator and the crime. Using this data, and with the help of infographics, an accurate representation of crime rates in each borrow can be conveyed and compared.</text>

<h3>Data cleansing</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Remove unneccessary data that the general public would not understand, such as law codes, jurisdiction codes, and classification codes using excel.</li>
    <li>Convert the trimmed dataset into a json object using <a href="https://github.com/reindeersled/Arrests-in-NYC-by-NYPD-in-2023/blob/main/data/format_data.py">format_data.py</a></li>
</ol>

<text>All data is from NYC OpenData.</text>
