    <p>Each dot represents an arrest made in 2023. From this map, it can be seen that Staten Island had by far the least number of arrests in 2023, making it the safest borough, whereas Manhattan was the densest in terms of arrests compared to its size. Central Park, however, is mostly free of dots, making it the safest place in Manhattan. Meanwhile, Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens were all relatively similar in arrest rates. However, while Queens had a lot of arrests, it is also the biggest borough, meaning the Bronx and Brooklyn had the highest crime rates.</p>
